# Discord Database
A fairly crude rest API, user web interface, and Discord scraper made for the final project in COMP 3005 at Carleton.

# NOTE
Issues are still being found with the scraper so it is not advised to use this software for any large scale scraping as of now. It works with Discord's older data particularly well however, as during testing I was able to get a whole 8M messages before hitting a foreign key error to which I've still not looked into.
